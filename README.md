# 🐍 Python Course Tasks

This repository contains Python scripts for various basic programming tasks, as part of a course project. Each task is saved in a separate `.py` file and explained below.

---

## ✅ Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations
This script takes two numbers as input and performs:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

**Sample Output:**

Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Division: 2.0


**File:** `task1_math_operations.py`

## ✅ Task 2: Personalized Greeting
This script:
- Takes the user's first and last name
- Combines them
- Greets the user personally

**Sample Output:**

Enter your first name: Aman
Enter your last name: Shah
Hello, Aman Shah! Welcome!


**File:** `task2_personalized_greeting.py`

---

## ✅ Task 3: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
This script takes an integer and checks whether it’s even or odd using an `if-else` condition.

**Sample Output:**

Enter an integer: 7
7 is Odd.


**File:** `task3_even_odd.py`

---

## ✅ Task 4: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
This script uses a `for` loop to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 50.

**Sample Output:**

Sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275


**File:** `task4_sum_1_to_50.py`

---

## ✅ Task 5: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
This script defines a function to calculate the factorial of a number using a loop.

**Sample Output:**

Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120


**File:** `task5_factorial_function.py`

---

## ✅ Task 6: Using Math Module for Calculations
This script uses the `math` module to:
- Calculate square root
- Compute natural logarithm
- Find sine of a number

**Sample Output:**

Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Natural Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine (in radians): -0.13235175009777303


**File:** `task6_math_module.py`

---

## ✅ Task 7: Read a File and Handle Errors
This script:
- Tries to read a file named `sample.txt`
- Prints the contents
- Displays an error message if the file does not exist

**Sample Output (if file exists):**

Contents of the file:
Line 1: Welcome
Line 2: To Python


**Sample Output (if file missing):**

Error: The file 'sample.txt' was not found.


**File:** `task7_read_file.py`

---

## ✅ Task 8: Write and Append Data to a File
This script:
- Takes user input
- Writes to `output.txt`
- Appends more data
- Reads and prints the entire file content

**Sample Output:**

Enter some text to write into the file: Hello there!
Enter some more text to append: Have a great day!
Final contents of the file:
Hello there!
Have a great day!


**File:** `task8_write_append_file.py`
