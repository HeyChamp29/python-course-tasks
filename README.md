# Python Course Tasks

This repository contains Python scripts created as part of a course assignment. It includes basic programs demonstrating user input, mathematical operations, conditionals, and loops.

---

## âœ… Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations
This script takes two numbers from the user and performs:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

**Sample Output:**
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5

Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2.0


**File:** `task1_math_operations.py`

## âœ… Task 2: Personalized Greeting
This script asks for your first and last name, combines them, and prints a greeting.

**Sample Output:**

Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe

Hello, John Doe! Welcome!


**File:** `task2_greeting.py`

---

## âœ… Task 3: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
This script takes an integer and checks whether itâ€™s even or odd using an `if-else` condition.

**Sample Output:**

Enter an integer: 7
7 is Odd.


**File:** `task1_even_odd.py`

---

## âœ… Task 4: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
This script calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.

**Sample Output:**

The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275


**File:** `task2_sum_1_to_50.py`

---

âœ… Task 5: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

This script defines a function factorial() that takes a number as input and calculates its factorial using a loop. The result is then printed using a sample value.

Sample Output:

The factorial of 5 is: 120


**File:** `task1_factorial.py`


---

âœ… Task 6: Using the Math Module for Calculations

This script takes a number as input from the user and uses Pythonâ€™s built-in math module to calculate:

Square root
Natural logarithm (base e)
Sine (in radians)
Sample Output:

Enter a number: 25

Square root of 25.0 is: 5.0  
Natural logarithm of 25.0 is: 3.2188758248682006  
Sine of 25.0 (in radians) is: -0.13235175009777303


**File:** `task2_math_module.py`


ðŸŽ¯ All scripts are beginner-friendly and run in standard Python environments (IDLE, PyCharm, etc.).
